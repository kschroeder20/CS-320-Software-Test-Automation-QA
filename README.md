### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by effectively using TDD and having a peer review of my tests to avoid ever-green tests. I can ensure that my code is secure by following Java's security best practices, running Maven dependency checks, and updating dependencies with the latest security updates.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs I ask a lot of questions during the client discovery meetings to make sure that the client and I are on the same page for what they want to accomplish. To incorporate them, I will thoroughly plan out the architecture of my code by using TDD concepts and pseudo coding.

### How do I approach designing software?

I design software by taking the time to plan out the architecture of the software before coding anything. I'll make sure that my architecture incorporates all of the client's requirements. I'll also create tests before writing the actual code and test for the client's requirements.
